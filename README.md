#to get it running on your machine you'll need to run these in your terminal:

1. npm i express
2. npm i path
3. npm install nodemon --save-dev
4. npm i vite
5. npm run devStart
6. the server should be online on http://localhost:5000/

5. if you do any changes on the server.js the server will restart automatically
6. if you do any changes on the front end you will need to close the server, run 'npm run build' and restart the server with 'npm run devStart'

thanks for your help.
